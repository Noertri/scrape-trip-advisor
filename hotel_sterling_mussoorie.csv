July 2022;3.0;Property is huge, lavish, well-maintained. Food is good too. But the main disadvantage is the location. It is is located at further 2.5 kms uphill from Library Chowk, Mall Road. Very narrow road from Library Chowk to Sterling. Quite risky for someone who doesn't drive in hilly areas. On top of that, they do not provide any pick and drop facility to mall road. You are on your own to venture out. The other issue is that of network. There is absolutely no network connectivity. Bare minimum of making a phone call is also not possible from room, you have to go near reception area to make a phone call.

July 2022;5.0;We visited Sterling Mussoorie with a group of 40 people and each and everyone enjoyed the stay and hospitality at this beautiful hotel. The view of the valley is very nice. Mr Ankur and his team takes care of each and every request from their guest. Breakfast spread is awesome and the quality of food is very good. The dinner with a wide variety of Indian, Continental and Asian. Garwali Thali was the catch amongst our group members. Chef Ranjan and his team assures that the guests should get the their choice of food and Hemant along with his team was very prompt and efficient in service. Make sure you ask to get a room closer to reception as the property is spread around and not everyone would like to move around too much. We really had a great decision to choose this hotel

June 2022;5.0;We Four members of a family alongwith Two little kids (Twins) stayed at the Sterling Mussoorie for Four Nights during the end of June 2022. While proceeding towards the property we were somewhat apprehensive as the road was quite narrow..... which is a normal phenomenon in the hills though... but the moment we reached the Sterling Resort all our anxiety vanished instantaneously. What an Expansive and Vast Property the Sterling Mussoorie is, with amazingly beautiful and majestic views of the Mussoorie Hills! The parking of our vehicle was immediately taken care by the their wonderfully efficient (Valet) Parking Staff. We were cordially welcomed by the smiling staff at the Reception/ Front Desk who promptly arranged to transfer our baggage to our rooms besides
June 2022;3.0;Pros: 1. Bfast buffet and dinner buffet had lots of variety and the restaurant staff is really polite and nice. 2. Room sizes are pretty decent, with some classic rooms almost as big as premium rooms (we took 2 classic rooms and 1 premium room) 3. Game room was quite good and my children really enjoyed spending time there 4. Spa was pretty good too with masseur being really professional and knowledgeable. Cons: 1. Approach to hotel is super hard. If your taxi is not dropping u to hotel, it becomes really challenging to reach hotel. Hotel doesn t even offer a pickup to Gandhi Chowk. It took us a porter, a rickshaw and finally a taxi and total spend of INR 900, not to mention the pain of lugging around our luggage and walking like crazy on streets of Mussoorie, to reach from

June 2022;3.0;"Pros - Location is good; near to library chowk (3-4 kms) but yet far from the crowd and hustle - Many indoor and outdoor activities - Kids would love the place - Clean property - Staff is courteous - Ample parking Cons - Food is pathetic and no restaurants nearby - They have put so many Godrej Air Power Pockets that it starts causing headache - They don t have liquor license, no bar in the hotel - People with knee pain and elderlies should strictly avoid this hotel because one needs to climb 100 stairs to reach the restaurant/ exit the hotel/ reach restaurants - Pricier, not value for money - Housekeeping staff needs some training; they couldn t convert a double bed into two single beds when it was clearly visible that it s doable - They pay no heed to your requests so do call"
June 2022;5.0;Location is big plus point, far away from the madening crowd, ideal for a staycation, if not interested in doing the touristy thing of visiting points (over crowded at any time) like Kempy falls or Lal Tibba point (landaur). The studio (classic) rooms were comfortable for a family of 3. Buffet spread for breakfast & dinner was awesome and desert options at the table was just superb and well worth every penny spent. The resort has ample outdoor and indoor activites for young children as well as play ground as well as entertainment programmes for young and old for evenings (tabola, musical games, karoke etc) . Wi-fi is bad/weak (being a sore point) and limited to only 2 users per room(disappointing for bigger families). Another sore point (lift). Get used to walking flight of

June 2022;5.0;We stayed in their privilege suite. Amazing room, spacious and well.kept with a nice balcony. 1. Recreation room is quite spacious and has enough paid as well as complimentary activities. Infact they do many activities throughout the day aswell. So great job by the team there. 2. Restaurant has a great team. Always smiling but I request if they could get some extra hands especially during season if you could hire some contractual staff. 3. The only trouble the hotel has its way to reach the hotel. Extremely narrow roads to even reach the mall one has to pay anything between 600-1000 for a round trip. 4. No provision for alcohol in the hotel and only availability at mall so better to be planned in advance. Had an amazing time. Stayed in many sterling properties by far my

May 2022;5.0;It was great staying at sterling resorts mussoori. The property is really nice there are several activites in wish you can take part and enjoy your stay without leaving the resort and the food also here is very nice.
May 2022;3.0;The resort is located on a hill top and has picturesque view. The hotel staff is friendly and humble too. The activities arranged by holiday activity team are interesting and engaging as well. Both indoor and outdoor activities are must to do, if you are staying in this resort. I would rate them 4 for their effort, dedication, work done on engagement of kids and adults. However, resort Food and Services Team definitely needs an improvement. The breakfast buffet is too small and has limited option to choose from. On top of it, they are not able to refill the buffet counters on time and without customer reminders. The variety in ala carte menu for lunch and dinner is not up to the mark. The taste of food is also average. The cleaning and fnb staff needs lot of improvement. The

Bets part was the view from My Room, it was mesmerizing. The mountain views were more than awesome. The hotel is located just 10 mins on bike from Mall Road and library. It is away from the noise of the main market and is quite silent. There is Spa, Indoor and outdoor activities for good experience. The staff is very helpful and the Front Desk Manager Mr. Mukesh is the best of them. He is very very helpful and does what he commits to you. Also he guides very well about mussorie. The Hotel is highly recommendable.

May 2022;3.0;Location absolutely stunning, getting there absolutely pathetic and treacherous, but our biggest problem was our room(2221) it was closer to Dehradhun than to the reception, the 170 stairs down is better than the steep climb up and i mean my 13 year old struggled. My brother is a member but if i had to pay for that room (12000 odd quoted here) i would have been furious and frustrated. The food is average for the price with limited variety. I was promised a room change that never came! Sterling should make it easier for their guests to get to their room rather than a heart testing adventure! The view is sensational and very pretty! Activities are many for kids to play but not cheap! Local transportation is non existent and taxis charge 500 for 2 kms to mall road, 3500 for 80 km

On 1 day When we ask to drink the whisky in garden which is adjoining to our room they refuse u cant drink whisky outside only in rooms.its hotel policy. On 2 second they said we will charge 1000 per bottle than u can drink. Now where is hotel policy. Than they said u cant have hooka in the hotel its against hotel policy. When we saw them that someone is having hokka than they said hokka is allowed only in room balcony. Now again their words are changed. Now third one they said speakers are not allowed in hotel premises we said ok. When we call the manage r & tell them please hear the sound someone is playing the speaker .than they have no answer to our question. There is mr vaibav
