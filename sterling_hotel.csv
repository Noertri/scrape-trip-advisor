July 2022;3.0;Property is huge, lavish, well-maintained. Food is good too. But the main disadvantage is the location. It is is located at further 2.5 kms uphill from Library Chowk, Mall Road. Very narrow road from Library Chowk to Sterling. Quite risky for someone who doesn't drive in hilly areas. On top of that, they do not provide any pick and drop facility to mall road. You are on your own to venture out. The other issue is that of network. There is absolutely no network connectivity. Bare minimum of making a phone call is also not possible from room, you have to go near reception area to make a phone call.

July 2022;5.0;We visited Sterling Mussoorie with a group of 40 people and each and everyone enjoyed the stay and hospitality at this beautiful hotel. The view of the valley is very nice. Mr Ankur and his team takes care of each and every request from their guest. Breakfast spread is awesome and the quality of food is very good. The dinner with a wide variety of Indian, Continental and Asian. Garwali Thali was the catch amongst our group members. Chef Ranjan and his team assures that the guests should get the their choice of food and Hemant along with his team was very prompt and efficient in service. Make sure you ask to get a room closer to reception as the property is spread around and not everyone would like to move around too much. We really had a great decision to choose this hotel

June 2022;5.0;We Four members of a family alongwith Two little kids (Twins) stayed at the Sterling Mussoorie for Four Nights during the end of June 2022. While proceeding towards the property we were somewhat apprehensive as the road was quite narrow..... which is a normal phenomenon in the hills though... but the moment we reached the Sterling Resort all our anxiety vanished instantaneously. What an Expansive and Vast Property the Sterling Mussoorie is, with amazingly beautiful and majestic views of the Mussoorie Hills! The parking of our vehicle was immediately taken care by the their wonderfully efficient (Valet) Parking Staff. We were cordially welcomed by the smiling staff at the Reception/ Front Desk who promptly arranged to transfer our baggage to our rooms besides
June 2022;3.0;Pros: 1. Bfast buffet and dinner buffet had lots of variety and the restaurant staff is really polite and nice. 2. Room sizes are pretty decent, with some classic rooms almost as big as premium rooms (we took 2 classic rooms and 1 premium room) 3. Game room was quite good and my children really enjoyed spending time there 4. Spa was pretty good too with masseur being really professional and knowledgeable. Cons: 1. Approach to hotel is super hard. If your taxi is not dropping u to hotel, it becomes really challenging to reach hotel. Hotel doesn t even offer a pickup to Gandhi Chowk. It took us a porter, a rickshaw and finally a taxi and total spend of INR 900, not to mention the pain of lugging around our luggage and walking like crazy on streets of Mussoorie, to reach from

June 2022;3.0;"Pros - Location is good; near to library chowk (3-4 kms) but yet far from the crowd and hustle - Many indoor and outdoor activities - Kids would love the place - Clean property - Staff is courteous - Ample parking Cons - Food is pathetic and no restaurants nearby - They have put so many Godrej Air Power Pockets that it starts causing headache - They don t have liquor license, no bar in the hotel - People with knee pain and elderlies should strictly avoid this hotel because one needs to climb 100 stairs to reach the restaurant/ exit the hotel/ reach restaurants - Pricier, not value for money - Housekeeping staff needs some training; they couldn t convert a double bed into two single beds when it was clearly visible that it s doable - They pay no heed to your requests so do call"
June 2022;5.0;Location is big plus point, far away from the madening crowd, ideal for a staycation, if not interested in doing the touristy thing of visiting points (over crowded at any time) like Kempy falls or Lal Tibba point (landaur). The studio (classic) rooms were comfortable for a family of 3. Buffet spread for breakfast & dinner was awesome and desert options at the table was just superb and well worth every penny spent. The resort has ample outdoor and indoor activites for young children as well as play ground as well as entertainment programmes for young and old for evenings (tabola, musical games, karoke etc) . Wi-fi is bad/weak (being a sore point) and limited to only 2 users per room(disappointing for bigger families). Another sore point (lift). Get used to walking flight of

June 2022;5.0;We stayed in their privilege suite. Amazing room, spacious and well.kept with a nice balcony. 1. Recreation room is quite spacious and has enough paid as well as complimentary activities. Infact they do many activities throughout the day aswell. So great job by the team there. 2. Restaurant has a great team. Always smiling but I request if they could get some extra hands especially during season if you could hire some contractual staff. 3. The only trouble the hotel has its way to reach the hotel. Extremely narrow roads to even reach the mall one has to pay anything between 600-1000 for a round trip. 4. No provision for alcohol in the hotel and only availability at mall so better to be planned in advance. Had an amazing time. Stayed in many sterling properties by far my
